# Code_Refactor

In this projected, I used HTML Semantics to make the code clearer and easier to maintain. This was done to simulate a real world scenario in the field. Often there may be a situation where a developer is updating someone else's code. This projects puts me in the position to do just that.
 
First, I configured the HTML file to include some modern semantic tags. These tags included: section, figure, aside, and footer tags. Next, in CSS, I made an effort to consolidate the code. Thus making it easier to read less repetitive.
